Problem Definition: As more and more enterprises are migrating their data from on-prem system to cloud environment, the use of cloud computing is scaling up rapidly. But this use is sometimes followed by an unprecedented high cloud cost usage due to uncontrolled use of resources, so there is a need to govern and predict such unprecedented high cost and taking steps to prevent such anomalies. This can be done by implementing a multi-agent anomaly detection system can oversee the predicted high cost in future by using Unsupervised Learning Algorithms and implement steps to prevent or control the cloud resources using LLM agents that can frame cloud commands.
